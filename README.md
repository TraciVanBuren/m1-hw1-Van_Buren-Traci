## About Me ##
I'm a vegetarian. My little friend in the picture is Kerraugh.
Two of my pasttimes include aerial arts and reading.
My family is made up of two cats-Aubrey and Jasper.
I love to travel and will be going to Florida and California this semester.
I live in a suburb of Washington, D.C.
## Past Coding Experience ##
I know a decent amount of HTML. I've coded four or five legal books for work. I'm pretty shakey in CSS and I don't know anything about JAVA or JAVAscript. Working with a command prompt has been terrifying. I'm afraid of wiping my hard drive.
## Career Goals ##
1. I ultimately want to get a position working at a non-profit in D.C. as a graphic designer. 
2. Most graphic designer positions want you to have some familiarity with web design, which I hope to gain in this class. 
3. I would also like to use the skills I gain in this class to redo and update my web portfolio: TraciVanBuren.com
